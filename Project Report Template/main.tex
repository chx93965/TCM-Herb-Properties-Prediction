\begin{abstract}
    This document has some guidelines to help you write the project report for ECE 1513. The abstract should describe the problem at hand, why is it significant, why do you want to use machine learning to solve it, what are the machine learning methods you are exploring and using, how will it solve the problem then highlight the results and main conclusion from the results. Recommended length is 200-250 words.
